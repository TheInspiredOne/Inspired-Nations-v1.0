Inspired-Nations-v1.0
=====================

A bukkit plugin that adds player controlled protection, governments, wars, and a closed economy built with economic models.

### What is Inspired Nations?
Inspired Nations is an economic protection protection plugin meant to be an alternative to Factions and Towny. My design goals were to make the plugin simple to use similar to Factions, but sophisticated enough for relatively complex interactions like with Towny. I wanted players to be able to build something grand and protect it with relatively high confidence that it is safe. At the same time I also wanted to give players a means to seize land from others. In addition, I felt that everything should be tied together by the economy. All to often the economy of a server feels like an afterthought. Money becomes a reward for playing the game rather than a tool, and all too often the concept of value is misunderstood by the players. It seems like even if everybody on the server is a billionaire, there is still the expectation of cheap goods. These are all problems I set out to address in Inspired Nations. The final and overarching goal of the plugin is to preserve all the aspects of vanilla minecraft while enabling players to participate on large public servers with high confidence that what they create can remain protected.
